# ^^^^ is outdated :(

# IMPORTANT: Use the <pre> tag around ALL user inputs.
# All <message> placeholders should be prefixed with <pre> and suffixed with </pre>
# Failure to do so may and likely will result in users being able to inject formatting in messages.

# All of the settings under this 'default' section can be applied to each channel individually to override these.
# These are provided as a way to configure default channel settings.
